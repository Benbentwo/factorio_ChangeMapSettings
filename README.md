# ChangeMapSettings

Allows you to change your map and map generation settings at any time you want. Note that map generation changes only apply to new chunks.

NOTE:
The 0.17 version of this mod is missing configuration options because those are missing from the lua api. Furthermore, frequency of water, trees and cliffs is inverted compared to the base game map generation screen. This is also an issue with the lua api.
The mod will remain in this state until the lua api is changed to properly expose everything.
